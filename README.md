# Hierarchical-Multiplexer
Author - Sartahk Kumar

In this project, I have implemented a 16:1 Multiplexer using hierarchical design in Verilog. To achieve this, I used five instances of 4:1 multiplexers. Each 4:1 multiplexer was further designed hierarchically using 2:1 multiplexers, with three instances of 2:1 multiplexers used per 4:1 multiplexer.

This layered approach showcases modular digital design, allowing for better scalability, easier debugging, and code reuse. The use of hierarchy not only simplifies the complexity of a large multiplexer but also aligns with efficient and organized hardware design methodologies.
